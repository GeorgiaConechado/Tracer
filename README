tracer - a Pythonic statistical ray-tracing software with solar energy focus.

About
-----
Tracer (temporary name) is (to be) a statistical ray-tracing engine and
suite of tools focused on solar energy applications.

The motivation for writing tracer:
* Current solutions lack programmability and extensibility
* Unless you pay megabucks
* De-facto standard tools of the trade are non-free, so bugfixing
  etc. depends on someone else,
* Usability in the solution closest to our budget is poor, and no Linux
  port is available.

Tracer is written in Python, using NumPy and SciPy for the math side of things.

Status
------
The code is advanced enough to produce research. It is currently a programming
library only, without a GUI. 

It is possible to build nested models using flat, paraboloid and spherical
surfaces, using various optical properties, or to derive new ones. A pillbox
sunshape model is provided, and any ray bundle can be programmatically created.

There are no provisions for spectral response or polarization yet.

Installation
------------
Currently there is no installation package, just copy the files into
the Python path.

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:
* NumPy
* SciPy
Both available from http://www.scipy.org/

To test that things are working, run the test-suite in the tests/
subdirectory, using nosetests or some similar tool.

Also check out examples/test_case.py as a starting-point to the code. Running it
requires matplotlib to be installed
